    <p>This page allows you to modify the master rating scheme that is used by Skills Base. You can configure the range
        of values that are used to rate skills and interest levels, as well as the accompanying labels and descriptions
        for each of those ratings. Rating labels are displayed in the legend on the right hand side when taking
        assessments, and descriptions appear when people hover their mouse over those labels. </p>
